# Hangman program, as the name suggests, allows us to play hangman game

Requirements: Python 3

# Program:
- asks the user to enter a password
- the password should be one word
- entering numbers or special characters will be rejected
- an empty space is created so that the opponent cannot see the password after entering
- the opponent only gets information about how many letters are in the password and that the password is not case-sensitive
- while playing, the opponent can guess by the letter or try to enter the whole password
- the letters tried that weren't in the password will be displayed
- if player exceeds the allowed number of password guessing attempts, the program will show him that he lost and what the password was
- if player can guess the password before reaching the limit, the program will display that the password was hit
- the program will ask if you want to play again

## Update

Graphical User Interface has been added to the project.

# The program allows you to generate a random password, specifying the number of individual characters, i.e. upper and lower case letters, special characters and numbers. It also allows you to generate a random password without specifying what should be in it.

Requirements: Python 3, random module

# Program:
- asks the user if he wants to specify the number of individual characters in his password
- if so, the user can define the number of upper and lower case letters, special characters and numbers
- if not, it only asks the user for the password length and generates it from a random combination of lowercase and uppercase letters,
  special characters and numbers
- allows you to generate the password again by asking if you want to specify the number of individual characters
